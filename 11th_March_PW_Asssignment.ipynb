    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It provides a way to revise our beliefs about the likelihood of an event occurring given new information. The theorem is named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century mathematician.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, Bayes's theorem can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",
    "\n",

    "- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of event A occurring.\n",
    "- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of event B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're at a clinic that offers a certain medical test for a rare disease. Let:\n",
    "- Event A be the occurrence of the disease (e.g., a patient having the disease).\n",
    "- Event B be the result of the medical test (e.g., a positive test result).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prior Probability (P(A)): Before conducting the test, let's say the prior probability of a person having the disease is 0.01, or 1% (this is based on historical data or general knowledge about the prevalence of the disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Likelihood (P(B|A)): The probability that the test correctly identifies a person with the disease is called the sensitivity of the test. Let's assume the sensitivity of the test is 0.95, or 95%. So, the likelihood of a positive test result given that the person has the disease is 0.95.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Probability of the Test Result (P(B)): To calculate the probability of a positive test result, we need to consider both true positive cases (when a person has the disease and the test correctly identifies it) and false positive cases (when a person does not have the disease but the test incorrectly indicates they do). Let's say the false positive rate of the test is 0.02, or 2%, implying a 98% specificity rate (the probability of a negative test result given that the person does not have the disease). Thus, \\( P(B) = (0.01 \\times 0.95) + (0.99 \\times 0.02) = 0.0293 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use Bayes's theorem to calculate the posterior probability of a person having the disease given a positive test result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",
    "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.01}{0.0293} \\approx 0.324 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, after receiving a positive test result, the probability of actually having the disease is approximately 32.4%. This example demonstrates how Bayes's theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event based on new evidence."
