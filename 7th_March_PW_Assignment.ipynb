They provide information about how spread out the values in the dataset are from the central tendency measures like the mean, median, or mode. Here's how each of these measures works and an example to illustrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of how widely the values are spread out.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Example: Suppose you have a dataset of exam scores for a class of students: {65, 70, 75, 80, 85}. The range would be 85 (maximum score) - 65 (minimum score) = 20.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Example: Continuing with the exam scores example, suppose the mean score is 75. The deviations from the mean are {-10, -5, 0, 5, 10}. Squaring these deviations gives {100, 25, 0, 25, 100}. The variance is the average of these squared deviations, which is (100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100) / 5 = 50.\n",

    "3. Standard Deviation: Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of how much individual data points deviate from the mean, in the same units as the original data.\n",

    "   Example: Using the same exam scores dataset, the variance was calculated to be 50. Therefore, the standard deviation is the square root of 50, which is approximately 7.07.\n",
