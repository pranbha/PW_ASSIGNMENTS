    "1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**\n",
    "   Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI aims to create systems that can perform tasks that would require human intelligence if done by a human. An example of AI is IBM's Watson, which defeated human champions in the quiz show Jeopardy! by processing natural language questions and searching through vast amounts of data to find the correct answers.\n",

    "2. **Machine Learning (ML):**\n",
    "   Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a certain task, machine learning algorithms use patterns and inference to learn from data and improve over time. An example of machine learning is recommendation systems used by companies like Netflix or Amazon. These systems analyze user behavior and preferences to recommend movies, products, or content tailored to individual users.\n",

    "3. **Deep Learning:**\n",
    "   Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. Deep learning algorithms attempt to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers composed of complex structures called neural networks. These networks can learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction, allowing them to perform tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. An example of deep learning is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image recognition tasks, such as identifying objects in photographs or videos."
